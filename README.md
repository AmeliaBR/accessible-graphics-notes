Presentation notes for my talk on accessibility in graphics (primarily SVG) at [Libre Graphics Meeting 2015](http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2015/program/) on 12 March 2015.  [View online](http://ameliabr.github.io/accessible-graphics-notes/ABR-AccessibleGraphics-LGM2015.html).

The slide layout and tabbing functionality is version 2 of one I created for [a previous talk on responsive SVG](https://github.com/AmeliaBR/responsive-svg-notes).  
I plan to eventually adapt the slide layout HTML/CSS/JS into a separate utility that I'll release as its own repo.  If you want to do something with them before I get around to doing that, just send me a note.
